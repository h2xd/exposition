Structure to explain the who, what and where of the API mocking process

_The ambition is to create a structure to enhance the creation, usage and experience of API mocking with [mswjs](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) and [miragejs](https://github.com/miragejs/miragejs)._


## Ideas

- [ ] Create an interface / controller to support various tools
- [ ] Find a good way to pass down a http return code for future integrations
- [ ] Create a E2E-Test integration
- [ ] Create examples how to generate api datasets
- [x] [Create a VueDevTools Plugin](https://github.com/h2xd/exposition/tree/main/packages/vue-devtools)
