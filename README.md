# Exposition

_Structure to explain the who, what and where of the API mocking process._

---

The ambition is to implement an interface structure to enhance the creation and usage of API mocking with [mswjs](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) and [miragejs](https://github.com/miragejs/miragejs).


## Ideas

- [ ] Create an interface / controller to support various tools
- [ ] Create a E2E-Test integration
- [ ] Create examples how to generate api datasets
- [ ] Create a VueDevTools Plugin
