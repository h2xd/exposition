## Future 💫

_I'm cooking new guides for the following topics:_

- **[`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/)** — 🐍 [Sneak peek](https://github.com/h2xd/exposition/blob/main/packages/integrations/msw/functions/defineMSWIntegration.spec.ts)
- **[`jest`](https://jestjs.io/)** — 🌿 _Similar to [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)_
- **[`@mswjs/data`](https://github.com/mswjs/data) + [`@faker-js/faker`](https://fakerjs.dev/)** — ⏲️ TBD
- **Cypress** — ⏲️ TBD

_Other topics in my head:_

- **How to send links your colleagues** — 🌐 [`@exposition/web`](https://github.com/h2xd/exposition/tree/main/packages/web) _looking at you_
- **SSR** — 🚌 Sync between backend and frontend
